# UnityPartialInputBlocker
A script designed to generate boxes around a designated screen space to only allow input in that area.

The project has a demo scene which will display just a button. Clicking on the button the first time will generate partial input blockers around the button so you can't click anywhere else other than around there.

Just a test for blocking input and only allowing a certain area, such as a tutorial or onboarding process where clicking elsewhere could become problematic. 

TODO::

Dynamically change the input blocker if the UI is also moving.
